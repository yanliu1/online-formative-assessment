We also created an interactive plot using R packages, "ploty" and"ggplotly", which is provided in Figure 4. 
This plot can show the response orders of all students in one picture. 
However, the reader can also see one student's response order by hovering the mouse on one line at a time.
Please see the plot via this link, http://rpubs.com/yanliu/ResponseOrder.
